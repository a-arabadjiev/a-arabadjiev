A 24-year-old enthusiast who delved into coding at 18 and never looked back. üöÄ With an analytical mindset, I draw inspiration from mainstream sources and approach coding methodically. I believe in innovating through improvement, constantly striving to enhance existing sources with fresh ideas. I'm primarily fluent in C# and have a soft spot for web development, but I'm always on the lookout to venture into uncharted technological territories. My projects reflect my passion for coding, aiming to create tools that aid friends and relatives or simply bring joy to others.
